Changes in LTKJava 1.0.0.7 (over previous LTKJava 1.0.0.6) - bug fix release - April 8th, 2012

Note: LTKJava 1.0.0.7 does not support LLRP 1.1

* changed BitOrder in TwoBitField from LSB to MSB first. Fixes bug 2927680.
[Basil Gasser]

* fixed bug that caused a compiler error when a parameter and one of its choice definition had a custom element and a custom extension parameter was "allowedIn" in the parameter
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* revert changes from 8/11/09 - Revision 1.17 from Utility.java and make LTKJava compliant to C and C++ implementations where allowedIn references to choice definitions are treated as extension of them.
Example: 
	<customParameterDefinition    name="MyCustom">
		...
   		<allowedIn repeat="0-1" type="AccessCommandOpSpecResult"/>
 	</customParameterDefinition>
 interpreted as if one added MyCustom to choiceDefinition:
 	<choiceDefinition name="AccessCommandOpSpecResult">
   		...
   		<parameter type="*MyCustom*"/>
 	</choiceDefinition>
[Basil Gasser]
* Annotations in message and parameter definitions are now optional (previously mandatory)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Parameter Annotations contained in custom parameter definitions now correctly added to generated Java files 
[Basil Gasser]

* made allowedIn references type aware, i.e. if a parameter is defined to be allowedIn in a certain type it is also allowed in any sub type defined using the choice definition
[Basil Gasser]

* fixed potential buffer overflow problem in encodeXML method of UnsignedLong_DATETIME.java - bug report and patch by Samuel Wieland
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug that prevented xml decoding of Custom parameter in choice definition [tracker: 2824818] -  bug reported by Rob Buck
[Basil Gasser]



Changes in LTKJava 1.0.0.6 (over previous LTKJava 1.0.0.5) 


* Fixed inconsistency in String representation. Default is now always radix 10. Internal representation is now LSB at bit 0 and MSB in bit 1 
[Basil Gasser]

* changed build.xml to remove duplicated path entries for extension xsd. Now paths have only to be configured in generator.properties.
[Basil Gasser]

* fixed inconsistency in TwoBitField.  
[Basil Gasser]

* added feature that overwrites schemaLocation for imports of llrp.xsd in extension XSDs. Previously, importing llrp xsd in an extension schema
and specifying www.llrp.org/... as the schemaLocation made the schema validator download llrp.xsd from llrp.org instead of accessing the local version 
in the jar.
[Basil Gasser, Christian Floerkemeier]

* added xerces as a dependency and adjusted import statements in org.llrp.ltkGenerator.Utility to eliminate compiler warnings 
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug that prevented correct decoding of xs:unsignedByte elements in LTK-XML messages
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug that prevented validation of extension schemas [tracker: 2723967] -  bug reported by Pradeep Gopal
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed issue with incorrect instantiation of the logger in generated classes [tracker: 2723972] -  bug reported by Kyle Neumeier
[Christian Floerkemeier]

Changes with LTKJava 1.0.0.5 production (over previous 0.1.0 ALPHA release)

* Changes to remove duplicated entries in build.xml. Added Custom ANT Task (CopySchemaFiles), changes in build.xml
[Basil Gasser]

* fixed bug in encodeXML of UnsignedByte_HEX
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* added UnsignedByte_HEX (U8 format HEX) and included references to specification
in Javadoc
[Basil Gasser]

* added SignedIntegerArray (S32v) and SignedShortArray(S16v) 
[Basil Gasser]

* updated LTKJava org.llrp.ltk.net package. LLRPConnector and LLRPAcceptor now automatically check the ConnectionAttemptStatus field in the READER_EVENT_NOTIFICATION. A LLRPConnectionAttemptFailed Exception is thrown is the connection attempt failed. The LLRPIoHandler automatically replies to KEEP_ALIVE messages. - patch by Li Cuizhu  
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug that resulted in NullPointerException when converting a message with Identification parameter from XML to binary
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed incorrect warning message about missing non optional parameter [tracker: 2095577] -  bug reported by Paolo Simonazzi
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug in synchronous messaging [tracker: 1997316] -  patch by Li Cuizhu 
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* improved XML validation performance - patch by Li Cuizhu 
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* added documentation from XML to JavaDoc 
[Basil Gasser]

* downgraded from MINA-2.0.1M to stable MINA-1.1.7. Release date of stable MINA-2.0.* is currently not known. Users of LTKJava only need to replace the MINA dependency with version 1.1.7. 
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug in XML encoding and decoding of UTCTimestamps reported by Li Cuizhu on the mailing list on 07/03/2008.
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* added getName method to all LLRP and custom parameters
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* changed log level when optional parameters are not used at binary encoding (was WARN is now INFO)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* refactored LLRPMessageFactory.java. This class was moved from org.llrp.ltk.generated.messages to org.llrp.ltk.generated. Note this change is not backwards compatible!
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* LTKJava now throws an InvalidLLRPMessageException when a LTK-XML message which can be validated against LLRP.xsd (due to the xsd:other) but which uses an extension that has not been defined in the corresponding ExtensionDef.xml
[Basil Gasser]

* resolved bug resulting from XML encoding empty u16v fields such as WriteData element
[Basil Gasser]

* resolved bug that caused problems loading the schemas from a jar (introduced by mistake in a recent commit)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* resolved issue with decoding of LTK-XML extension parameters in LLRP messages
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* resolved issue with decoding of LTK-XML extension messages which was caused by a bug in LLRPMessageFactory and namespace error in all parameter decodeXML methods
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug in BytesToEnd_HEX which did not encode xsd:hexBinary correctly
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Changed LLRPMessage to throw an InvalidLLRPMessageException if the length of the message received is not equal to the length indicated in the message's length field
[Basil Gasser]

* Fixed bug in xsd:dateTime encoding (time zone was not set correctly)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Fixed u16v XML encoding bug which caused a XSD validation error for example for "WriteData" element
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Resolved "Version attribute" issue that was raised in Paul Dietrich's email to the mailing list on 06/09/2008. LTKJava wrongly assumed that the Version attribute was required. If version attribute is not set in LTL-XML message, the version is set to "001" by default.   
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Corrected mistake in org.llrp.ltk.util.LLRPConverter.java command line documentation
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Fixed bug 1849514 (Timestamp problem) after inconsistency between llrpdef.xml and LLRP.xsd was resolved (Bug 1974880)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Resolved LLRPBinaryDecoder issue in the messaging package of LTKJava. See email and patch by Li Cuizhu from 06/05/2008.
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Refactored org.llrp.ltk.util.LLRPConverter.java and org.llrp.ltk.util.Util.java
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Fixed Bug in decodeXML in UnsignedByteArray_HEX 
[Basil Gasser]

* removed String delimiter in String representation of BitList
[Basil Gasser]

* refactored XML encoding of LLRP types
